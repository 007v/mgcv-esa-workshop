### Title of the session

Fitting non-linear models in R with the mgcv package

### Description of the session (appears online only; 250 words max.)

To address the increase in both quantity and complexity of available data, ecologists require flexible models. This workshop will focus on on fitting generalized additive models (GAMs) - robust models for non-linear relationships - using the mgcv package for the R language.

mgcv is one of the most popular packages for modelling non-linear relationships. However, many users do not know how versatile and powerful a tool it can be. This workshop will focus on teaching participants how to use mgcv in a wide variety of situations (including spatio-temporal, zero-inflated, heavy-tailed, time series, and survival data) and advanced use of mgcv (fitting smooth interactions, seasonal effects, spatial effects, Markov random fields and varying-coefficient models).

The workshop will give paricipants an understanding of: (a) practical elements of smoothing theory in GAMs, with a focus on why they would choose to use different types of smoothers (b) model checking and selection (c) the range of modelling possibilities using mgcv.  It will include both lecture and hands-on exercises. Participants should be familiar with the basics of R (loading/manipulating data, functions, and plotting) and regression in R (lm() and glm()). The organizers have extensive practical and teaching experience with ecological statistics and modelling using mgcv.

### Summary sentence (appears in print only; 50 word max.)

Non-linear relationships are ubiquitous in ecology.  This workshop will focus on a using mgcv, a versatile and powerful R package, to fit models to a variety of ecological data. It will cover practical elements of theory, hands-on model fitting, and a review of the range of model options and possibilities.

### Minimum and maximum number of participants (to assist in room assignment).
10 minimum, 30 maximum.

### Requested scheduling
Saturday (August 6th), all day. 

### Any additional A/V equipment (standard A/V setup is a screen, LCD projector, and laptop)
We will need the standard setup, as well as wifi access and enough power outlets for all participants.

### Room set-up desired: theater, conference, hollow square, rounds, other
A conference room. We prefer long tables in rows so that participants may use their laptops while viewing the projection screen.

### Food and beverage requests
No food or beverages requested.

### Underwriting of workshop costs by a group or agency
None of the costs will be underwritten.

### Is the session intended to be linked to a scientific session?
No.

### Is the session intended to be linked to a business meeting or mixer?
No. 

### Describe any known (workshop/event) scheduling conflicts (what should it follow/precede/not conflict with?)
We would require a Saturday time slot, as one of the organizers (Gavin Simpson) is also organizing 
the Advanced Vegan Workshop Proposal on Sunday AM and attending the ESA Council meeting on Sunday PM.
